# gtm-template-seo-sessions-ga4

Template used for tracking sessions for GA4. 
It will trigger a dataLayer push every time a new visit from a search engine is detected.  
You can customize some details on the template, such as the dataLayer push event name or the time that your sessions will last.
You can also add extra info to the push (like h1, canonical, metarobots...), although you will need to create your own variables to extract most of them.
